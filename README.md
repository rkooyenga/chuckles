Chuckles is a tribute to my almost career long business partner. A sometimes frightening man, of incredible intensity and strong convictions. A decisive man who knows what he wants and even more, what he does not, except when he confuses the two and proceeds to shoot us both in the foot or finally just me in the back when I'm trying to give him money and opportunity. It's tragic, but it's certifiable, verifiable, incontrovertible the events in all their absurdity that I memorialize with this as I rush through a quick haphazard draft build in my experimenting on MSB which I have not done in 15+ years. Charles is a man with whom I've shared good wine good laughs and a string of literally countless million dollar companies we together built and gave away for one reason or another. It's focus is the last few conversations we had in person or corresponding via messaging after he iced me out of our mutual interests leaving me to burn.
